<h1 align="center">NHIF API Documentation</h1>

This is an attempt to re-write the official NHIF's API in a developer friendly way.

The current documentation is written in PDF which makes it difficult to work on and hard to browse through the documentation.

This is an attempt to make it easier for developers to work on this new & exciting API.

A lot of effort was spent to make this as accurate as possible, However, If there is any error/confusion please refer to the original documents.

## Contributions

This documentation is created using `mkdocs` therefore in order run it locally you need to have python, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and ofcourse [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) installed

Using venv

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the live-reloading docs server.

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

Now you can view the documentation by just going to `http://localhost:8000`
